The Spelman AutoGrader program is designed to help grade Python and C++ programs submitted through Moodle.  To use the program, perform a 'download all submissions' of the target assignment from Moodle.  Extract the downloaded zip file.  This will create a directory on disk that holds all student submissions.  We will call this directory our 'top-level directory' (TLD).  Usually, the TLD contains program files (*.cpp, *.h, *.py, etc) and/or zip files.  If a student submits a single-file program, then that program appears as a .cpp or .py file in the TLD.  If a student submits a multi-file program (a .cpp and a .h file, for example) then the TLD contains a zip file.  This zip file contains the multiple submitted files.  AutoGrader assumes that all program files in the TLD are single-file programs and will attempt to process them individually.  By default, AutoGrader will uncompress any zip files in the TLD into a subdirectory and will treat all program files in the sub-directory as components of a single executable.  For C++, one (and only one) of the multiple source files should contain a main().  For Python, the top-level module must be specified among the multiple .py files.  By default, AutoGrader assumes that top-level Python modules are named 'main.py'.  For this reason, it is advisable to instruct students to name their top-level Python modules 'main.py' when submitting multi-file projects.
